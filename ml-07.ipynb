    "Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that provide specific functionalities, making programming more efficient and reducing the need to write code from scratch. These libraries cover a wide range of applications, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. Some libraries, such as os, sys, math, json, and datetime, come built-in with Python as part of its standard library, providing essential functions for file handling, system operations, mathematical computations, and data serialization. Other popular third-party libraries, like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, must be installed separately and are widely used in data science and machine learning. The extensive availability of libraries in Python's ecosystem makes it a versatile and powerful programming language for various domains. <br>\n",

    "Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides flexible data structures, such as DataFrames and Series. It is widely used for handling structured datasets, enabling easy data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation. Pandas is essential for data preprocessing in machine learning and statistical analysis. <br>\n",
