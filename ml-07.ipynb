    "### Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Life expectancy is a central metric used to assess the health and development status of populations across the globe. It reflects the average number of years a person can expect to live, assuming that current mortality rates persist. Given its sensitivity to a wide range of health, social, and economic conditions, life expectancy serves as a comprehensive indicator for public health monitoring and policy evaluation (Marmot, 2005). Accurately predicting life expectancy using relevant predictors can enable governments, health organizations, and researchers to better understand the drivers of longevity and identify intervention points to improve population health outcomes. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilizes the Life Expectancy (WHO) dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle (Kumar, 2017). The dataset spans from the year 2000 to 2015 and includes 193 countries, capturing both developing and developed regions. Variables in the dataset represent a diverse set of indicators including adult mortality, alcohol consumption, hepatitis B immunization coverage, GDP, BMI, HIV/AIDS prevalence, schooling, and health expenditure. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to apply regression modeling techniques to predict life expectancy using various socioeconomic and health-related features. This involves exploring the structure and quality of the data, selecting relevant features, applying and comparing multiple regression models, and interpreting the results to draw actionable insights. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Framework and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in any data-driven investigation is an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA). Through visualizations such as histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, and heatmaps, patterns and distributions can be observed, while anomalies, missing values, and potential outliers can be identified. EDA serves to inform subsequent modeling decisions and aids in understanding the relationships between predictors and the target variable. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Tukey (1977), exploratory data analysis plays a critical role in revealing structure in data that may not be apparent through formal statistical modeling. It promotes the generation of insights and hypotheses by relying on graphical techniques and descriptive summaries. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preparation and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing includes: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling missing values using statistical imputation or row-wise deletion where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encoding categorical variables, such as country development status, into numerical formats using label or one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outlier detection and treatment based on inter-quartile ranges or z-scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature scaling, particularly through standardization, to ensure that features contribute equally during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "These preprocessing techniques are essential to minimize bias and variance in the resulting models, thereby enhancing their predictive performance and interpretability (Han, Pei, & Kamber, 2011). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Selection and Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection involves identifying the most influential variables to include in the model. This step can be guided by domain knowledge, correlation analysis, or automated methods such as recursive feature elimination (RFE). In the context of life expectancy, prior research suggests that variables such as income level, education, health spending, and disease prevalence are strong predictors (Preston, Heuveline, & Guillot, 2001). Feature engineering may involve creating new variables by combining existing ones (e.g., healthcare expenditure per capita) or transforming variables to better capture non-linear relationships. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression Modeling Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary modeling technique used in this project is linear regression, which serves as a baseline model. Linear regression is widely used for its simplicity and interpretability and is suitable for quantifying linear relationships between the target variable and the predictors. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve accuracy and accommodate non-linear relationships, polynomial regression will also be implemented. This allows the model to capture curvature in the data that linear models may fail to represent. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, pipelines will be created to streamline the modeling process, combining preprocessing steps with model training in a reproducible workflow. Pipelines reduce data leakage and improve consistency in cross-validation and testing (Pedregosa et al., 2011). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- R^2 (coefficient of determination) to measure the proportion of variance explained,\n",
    "\n",
    "- MAE (mean absolute error) to assess average prediction error,\n",
    "\n",
    "- RMSE (root mean squared error) to penalize large errors more heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics will be compared across models to determine which configuration yields the most accurate and generalizable predictions. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Outcomes and Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this analysis, the most influential factors affecting life expectancy across countries will be identified. This will not only offer insight into global health trends but also provide evidence-based recommendations for policy interventions. The results may support the allocation of resources to areas such as education, disease prevention, and economic development—all shown to impact longevity in prior research (Cutler, Deaton, & Lleras-Muney, 2006). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project also serves as a practical demonstration of applying machine learning techniques within the public health domain. The modeling strategies, visualization techniques, and interpretive frameworks developed herein can be extended to other datasets and problem domains involving continuous outcomes. <br>"

    "### Reflection 1: What do you notice about the dataset? Are there any data issues?\n",

    "Upon reviewing the summary statistics and missing value analysis of the Life Expectancy dataset, several important observations emerge. First, the dataset spans a substantial time period from 2000 to 2015 and includes a broad set of features covering public health, demographic, and economic indicators. Most variables are numerical and display reasonable ranges, though some have wide standard deviations indicating high variability across countries and years. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of data completeness, there are several columns with missing values. For instance, Population has the highest proportion of missing data at approximately 22.2%, followed by Hepatitis B (18.8%) and GDP (15.2%). Additional variables such as Total expenditure, Alcohol, and Income composition of resources also contain notable gaps. These missing values will need to be addressed either through imputation or removal depending on their impact on modeling. Fortunately, the target variable, Life expectancy, has a relatively low missing percentage (0.34%), which should not severely impact the regression analysis. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a few variables such as Measles and under-five deaths display extreme maximum values, which may indicate the presence of outliers. The percentage expenditure variable also has a very high maximum value (over 19,000), suggesting potential data entry anomalies or extreme variation that warrants further investigation. These issues should be explored in detail during the data cleaning and preparation phase. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the dataset is rich and well-structured for regression modeling, some preprocessing steps including missing value imputation, outlier handling, and potential normalization or transformation will be necessary to ensure robust and interpretable model performance. <br>\n",
