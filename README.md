Final Project: Regression Analysis - Predicting Life Expectancy Using Regression Analysis: A Data-Driven Approach

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting life expectancy using a dataset published by the World Health Organization, covering global health, economic, and demographic indicators from 2000 to 2015. The dataset includes information from 193 countries and features variables such as mortality rates, immunization coverage, alcohol consumption, GDP, and education levels. <br>

The goal is to build and compare regression models that identify key predictors of life expectancy. The analytical process includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and outliers, feature selection, and model evaluation using metrics like RÂ², MAE, and RMSE. Both linear and polynomial regression models will be implemented, with pipelines used to streamline training and testing. <br>

Ultimately, the project aims to uncover insights that can inform health policy and resource allocation while demonstrating practical applications of regression modeling in a public health context. <br>

## Overview
Businesses and organizations must understand the relationships between different factors to make better decisions. <br>
For example, a company may want to predict a car's fuel efficiency based on its weight and engine size or estimate home prices based on square footage and location. <br>
Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making. <br>

This project demonstrates your ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will: <br>

## Dataset 

**Life Expectancy (WHO)**  
Source: [Kaggle - Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)

This dataset, provided by the World Health Organization, includes global health, economic, and demographic indicators from 2000 to 2015. It covers 193 countries and provides variables such as mortality rates, immunization coverage, alcohol consumption, GDP, and education levels, all relevant to analyzing and predicting life expectancy. <br>
